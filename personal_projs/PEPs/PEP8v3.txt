PEP 8 Summary:


PEP 8 is Python’s **style guide** for writing clean and readable code.  

### **Key Guidelines:**  

1. **Indentation:** Use **4 spaces** per level (no tabs).  
2. **Line Length:** Max **79 characters** (72 for comments).  
3. **Imports:** Standard library → Third-party → Local modules.  
4. **Naming:**  
   - Variables/Functions: `lower_case_with_underscores`  
   - Classes: `CamelCase`  
   - Constants: `ALL_CAPS`  
5. **Whitespace:**  
   - One space around operators (`a = b + c`).  
   - No extra spaces inside brackets (`spam(ham[1])`).  
6. **Comments:** Use `#` for inline, `"""Triple quotes"""` for docstrings.  
7. **Best Practices:**  
   - Use `is` for `None` (`if x is None`).  
   - Avoid `import *`.  
   - Use `with` for file handling.  

Following PEP 8 improves code **readability and consistency**. 
You can check compliance using `pycodestyle`.
