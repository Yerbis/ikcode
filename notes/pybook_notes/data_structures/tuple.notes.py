# How a tuple is structured


frogs = ('Bullfrog', 'Toad.', 'tree frog',)
#       ^                                 ^
#     Parentheses                     Parentheses




# A tuple is like a list, but it is -immutable-, 
# which means it cannot change any of the values inside

# A tuple looks a lot like a list, but isnt. It uses "()" instead of "[]"


# What if we want to store one string inside a tuple? You might do it like this:

string = ('Hello')

# If you print it you will see that it turns into a string, not a tuple. 
# This is how you would do it:

tuple = ("Hello",)
#               ^
#      This comma is what makes it a tuple, as a tuple requires one to be a tuple

# And that's literally all there is to tuples. Yep, that's it. Just a non changeable list.
